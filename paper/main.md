## My cool nuclear paper 
#### Author: Madicken Munk

### Intro

In this paper I discuss the relative importance of uranium isotopes for fission applications in medical isotope production. Medical isotopes, especially Tc-99 are in short demand and could be produced in low power research reactors. 

### Background 
Uranium is a heavy element with common isotopes U-235 and U-238

Plutoniumm is not as efficient as producing Mo-99
